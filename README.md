Project Title:
SQL Data Analysis Project: Online Bookstore Database Management and Insights

ðŸ”¹ Project Description :
I designed and implemented a relational database for an Online Bookstore using PostgreSQL. The project involved:

ðŸ“¦ Creating and managing normalized tables for Books, Customers, and Orders.

ðŸ“Š Writing over 20+ SQL queries to answer real-world business questions and perform:

Revenue and sales insights (e.g., top genres, bestselling authors).

ðŸ“¥ Importing CSV datasets using the COPY command and automating the data ingestion pipeline.

ðŸ”Ž Performing joins, aggregations, groupings, and filtering to generate insights.
